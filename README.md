Gather data from multiple sources on coaching pay data for college football programs across the country and answer the following questions:
  1. What is the recommended salary for the Syracuse football coach?
  2. What would his salary be if we were still in the Big East? What if we went to the Big Ten?
  3. What schools did we drop from our data and why?
  4. What effect does graduation rate have on the projected Total Pay?
  5. How good is our model?
  6. What is the single biggest impact on salary size?
