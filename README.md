## Coaching Pay Analysis:
Gather data from multiple sources on coaching pay data for college football programs across the country and answer the following questions:
  1. What is the recommended salary for the Syracuse football coach?
  2. What would his salary be if we were still in the Big East? What if we went to the Big Ten?
  3. What schools did we drop from our data and why?
  4. What effect does graduation rate have on the projected Total Pay?
  5. How good is our model?
  6. What is the single biggest impact on salary size?


## Image Recognition & Classification
Compare multiple approaches to image classification and compare the accurace and trade-offs of each approach.  
### Techniques utilized were:  
 * Neural Network
 * Random Forest
 * KNN
 * Decision Tree
 * Naive Bayes

## Mentoring Materials
The contexts of this folder contains the solutions for SQL training programs I have implemented in the past for those new to SQL at AmerisourceBergen. These were created for testers who required a greater understanding of SQL for client analytics testing

## Predicted Investment Opportunities
Thie project utilized time series analysis along with other techniques to assess historical housing & real estate data and forceast average median housing value by zipcode for 2018. 
### Techniques utilized:
 * Time series analysis
 * Monthly & Annual Time Series Decomposition
